More than just a luxury hotel, it's a national monument, a time capsule meticulously preserved and celebrated. Stepping through its doors is like stepping back into a bygone era, where ceiling fans whirred and the aroma of afternoon tea filled the air.

While not a traditional school, imagine the manicured lawns surrounding Raffles as a sophisticated sports field, where generations have indulged in croquet and leisurely pursuits. The hotel's architecture, with its white facade and stately columns, speaks of a colonial past, while its meticulously maintained gardens offer a serene escape from the bustling city.

Raffles is a repository of stories, hosting literary giants, royalty, and dignitaries for over a century. Itâ€™s a place where history is not just read about, but experienced, making it a cornerstone of Singapore's cultural identity and a must-see for anyone seeking a glimpse into the nation's captivating past.
